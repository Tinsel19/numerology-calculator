        The Transits are included in your developmental and will reveal a lot about
        certain influences in your life during various years. The letters of your first,
        middle, and last names are used to create transits. Each name represents a different
        aspect of your consciousness (physical, mental, or spiritual). The Physical Transit
        is based on your first name, while the Mental Transit is based on your middle
        name, and the Spiritual Transit is based on your last name.
